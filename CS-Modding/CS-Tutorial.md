# LW - C\# Modding

## Mods
For each mod you would want files to store that additions you want to make to the game.  
A usual structure looks like:
```
Logic World/GameData
    - <mod>/
        - components/
            - <component>.succ
        - src/
            - server/
                - <loader>.cs
                - <modname-component>.cs
        - manifest.succ
        - ignore #optional
```

### `<mod>/manifest.succ`

This is information about your mod. It is what will be shown in the mod list in-game, and the ID is prefixed to components in the item menu so it's best to keep it short. It doesn't have to be unique, so if you want to make multiple mods it will keep your things together (think of it as a namespace).
```js
ID: exampleID
Name: exampleName
Author: exampleAuthor
Version: 0.0.0
Priority: 1
```

### `<mod>/components/<component>.succ`

This is what defines your component as a placeable item in-game. See the examples in `Logic World/GameData/MHG/Components` or https://docs.logicworld.net/articles/component-reference.html

Components will appear in the item menu like this:  
```xml
<Manifest ID>.<Name in component succ>
```

Using the example manifest above, and this example succ:
```succ
exampleComponent:
    column: "Logic"
    prefab:
        blocks:
            - Standard
        inputs:
            -
                position: (0, 0.5, -0.5)
                rotation: (-90, 0, 0)
        outputs:
            -
                position: (0, 0.5, 0.5)
                rotation: (90, 0, 0)
    logicCode: exampleID.exampleComponent
    placingRules:
        gridPlacingDimensions: (2, 1)
...
```

The item would appear in-game as `exampleID.exampleComponent`

![exampleID.exampleComponent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7610940/138955557-42657956-80c9-4778-9743-2ffcd2a55edf.png)

### `<mod>/src/server/<modname-component>.cs`

This is where your component logic goes. It can contain other code too, and you can have multiple components defined in 1 file. If your file is big and you want to split it you can create multiple files but make sure to follow the format. But anything used in code referenced using logicCode in your succ file **MUST** be in here, the rest will not be loaded by the time the component types are compiled. You'll have to use reflection for anything external (so probably just accept the big file). You should prefix the filename with the same name as the mod folder so it's easier to find and delete when removing the mod

If you want to use the full capabilities of of the component system (inputs, outputs, updating logic each server tick etc.) your component should extend LogicComponent from LogicWorld.Server.Circuitry.

Here is an example:
```cs
using LogicAPI.Server.Components;

namespace exampleID
{
    public class exampleComponent : LogicComponent
    {
        protected override void DoLogicUpdate()
        {
            base.Outputs[0].On = base.Inputs[0].On;
        }
    }
}
```
And how to load the code you will need to create a new file and name it `Loader.cs` for example and put this code in it.
```cs
using LogicAPI.Server;
using LogicLog;

public class Loader : ServerMod {
    protected override void Initialize() {
        Logger.Info("mod initialized");
    }
}
```
That is how your mod will be loaded.

This example simply sets the single output to the single input each time the server ticks. More info on [LogicComponent](CS-LogicComponent.md) and its features coming soonâ„¢

### `<mod>/ignore`
If this file is present, the mod will not be loaded.
